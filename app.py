    Welcome to the Business Viability Analysis application, part of our research to assess and classify 
    business potential across regions in the Philippines using data-driven insights.

    This project leverages socio-economic data, household expenditures, and demographic factors to provide 
    a comprehensive overview of regional market conditions. Our goal is to support data-driven decision-making 
    for entrepreneurs and policy makers by identifying regions with high potential for various business types.

    ### What Youâ€™ll Find Here:
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights into key features and socio-economic distributions across regions.
    - **Factor Analysis and Clustering**: Uncover patterns to identify regional profiles based on factors like income, spending, and assets.
    - **Business Viability Scoring**: See scores and clusters indicating which regions are more business-friendly.
